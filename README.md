# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

My first venture into using streamlit for Data Analysis project. 

The goal of this project is to create an application for the use of the marketing / product
development and sales teams of a telecommunication company. This application uses
customer churn data and returns graphs and figures with insights that can lead to
developments of products and a marketing plan aimed towards customers that are likely
to stay with the company for longer. It can also be used to develop a sales strategy that
helps customers choose products appropriate for them, so they do not become unhappy
with their service and leave.


To make this project IBM’s public sample set called “Telecom Customer
Churn” has been used. The dataset is meant to simulate a typical dataset of a Telecommunications
company..

The dataset contains 7043 observations (rows) and 22 variables (columns) that contain
information about customer demographics (gender, senior citizenship status, children,
and marital status), services they signed up for (phone line, multiple lines, online
security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV and Movies),
account information (type of contract, payment type, paperless billing, monthly and total
charges), and churn (which customers left within the past month when the data was
collected). The dataset has been preprocessed leading to the creation of a new dataset preprocessed_data.csv
